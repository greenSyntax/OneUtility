Abstract

ItÎéÎ÷s a payment management system. Since, we all have once paid the bill either it is a phone bill, broadband bill or electricity bill. ItÎéÎ÷s always a challenge for the corporate house or government to satisfy customer by their service. So, we have built a product on Electricity Payment System. 

General Overview

 It is much like an online payment system. But, it targets the Electricity so, what a customer needs and their security is concerned. On the other site, we have prepared a portal for the administration purpose. Since, itÎéÎ÷s not a single-end software product. So, it can be handled easily on administratorÎéÎ÷s side.

  Site Overview

  Taking on the implementation, we have assured you to put it as a web based or a desktop based. At the end, itÎéÎ÷s a User based product which must be benefited by the common users along with the maintenance team which work hard on the record management.

  System Analysis

  Identification of Need:
  Identification of the need is the process of finding out the basic requirement of the project. It is a vital stage and requires thorough analysis. In case of this project, the basic need is to develop a user friendly, feature-rich, practical Online Voting System. 



  Preliminary Investigation:
  This activity involves interviewing the end users and customer and studying the existing documents and materials to collect all possible information. The purpose of this activity is to understand the exact requirements of the customer. We have to identify and eliminate the various problems of anomalies, inconsistencies and incompleteness.




  Feasibility Study

       It includes the following-
       1)	Technical Feasibility
       2)	Economical Feasibility
       3)	Operational Feasibility


       1)	Technical Feasibility:
       Since the project is design with ASP.NET with C# as code behind and SQL server 2008 as backend, it is easy to install in the systems whenever needed. It is more efficient, easy and user friendly to understand by almost everyone. Huge amount of data can be handled efficiently using SQL server as backend. Hence this project has good technical feasibility. As per the technical aspect the project College Management System is technically suitable for the user as well as the developer.





       2)	Economical Feasibility:
       Economic feasibility is mainly concern with the cost incurred during the implementation of the software. Since the project is developed using ASP.NET with C# and SQL server which is more commonly available and even the cost involved in the installation process is not high. Similarly it is to recruit persons for operating the software. Since almost all the people are aware of ASP.NET with C# and SQL server. Even if we want to train the person in these areas, the cost involved in training is also very less. Hence this project has good economic feasibility.






       3)	Operational Feasibility:
       As this ASP.NET component is very easy to operate for the software engineers and easy to use. So this project has a good operational feasibility.

           Hence this project is technically, economically as well as operationally feasible.
